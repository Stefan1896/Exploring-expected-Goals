# Exploring Expected Goals (Python)

I just started learning python before starting this project, therefore my main goal of this project is to get used to the python language and creating some interesting graphs and tables.

The project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/elky96/exploring-expected-goals-in-european-soccer-data).
